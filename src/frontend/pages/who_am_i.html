                This guy knows what he's talkng about. My name is
                <strong>Ashik</strong> and as part of survival I have become so
                many things. A Software Developer, A Music Enthusiast, A Mentor
                (that's what some of my colleagues say). I have spent
                <span id="experience">?</span> years as a Software Developer in
                various companies.
